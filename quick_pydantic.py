# Pydantic is a Python library used to:

# Validate Data: Ensure data fits a certain structure or meets specific criteria.
# Parse Data: Convert data types, like turning a string into an integer.
# Model Data: Define how data should look using classes, making it easier to handle and understand.
# Example: Imagine you're building a website where users sign up. You want to ensure that every user provides a valid email and a password. Pydantic can help by creating a model for a user and then checking if the provided data fits that model.

# Here's a simple example with Pydantic:

from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    email: str
    password: str

# If someone tries to create a User without an email or password, 
# or with invalid data types, Pydantic will raise an error.

# here is anoiher example:

from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

# This will work
user = User(name="Alice", age=30)

# This will raise a validation error because age is not an integer
invalid_user = User(name="Bob", age="thirty")
